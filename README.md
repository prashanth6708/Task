Hello,
it took me 1:30 hours to complete the assignment.
I have clearly separated the concerns and appropriately named the functions, variables.

Boilerplate:
I used create-react-app Boilerplate to set up the app. I have focused more on the functionality of the UI than the styling.

Hurdles.
1, since I do not have a wireframe to design, I tried placing elements on the fly until I felt the UI looks good. I can able to put UI much faster if i have wireframes and exact dimensions
2, I add only dpci(I'm not sure what dpci stands for) to the cart as this is only unique product key I have seen in the item object. we can also add whole item object to provide a view of cart with item details. I kept it simple.

Please suggest any enhancements/ coding style /pattern, I would definitely add them.
Thanks for reviewing the assignment.
